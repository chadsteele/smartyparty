Basic Human Resources: the Elementals
This finite list of Basic Human Resources is the result of continuous dialogue, reflection, research and practice in diverse locations and with diverse individuals and groups.  It identifies an elegant, simple framework and context for self ownership and design for practicing valuable competencies and increasing capacities.

As a representation of the conversation, this list and the descriptions may undergo refinement and adjustment.

If you got to this page without first reading the “Use it or Lose it” document, you may want to start there in order to understand the context more completely.

Senses:
Our senses give us access to experimenting. We urge you to consider all of the senses, and play with how much you have adapted to the lack of use of these elemental resources.  Remember, as a child, you could use sight and focus on an object for long periods of time, looking, leading to wondering, yet as you grow older, your habits have you often miss the details that could be present.  Taste is something you have stopped using, often times not allowing for you to experiment and try new things, just as much as not moving can cause you poor health or adapting to the lack of your voice will eventually have you become silent.   Our hearing is almost habitually tuned to what we are used to hearing and unlike a child who revels in new sounds, our listening becomes habitual and we begin to consider the world from those habitual thoughts, versus being able to consider multiple points of view.   All of us have had moments where a smell cued a memory, yet how often we practice the use of our sense of smell with any intention.  It is the one sense that travels directly to a location within our brain.  Yet it is touch that is now considered by many researchers to be the most valuable of our senses.  Touch provides a sense of connection and contentment, (see emotions) and assures us we belong as well as are known.   In some societies, touching between humans is taboo, and  as an example some states in the U.S.A.  legislates touching in schools.  The touch we are talking about, is the human-to-human contact AND the ability to use our sense of touch to navigate. Many people we work with describe touch as one of the elemental resources they have stopped using.

Instincts:  Though procreation, hunger and pain are obvious evolutionary survival mechanisms and  can be useful as elemental basic human resources, we at BoldLeaders tend to focus on the instinct called fear.  This elemental basic human resource could be one of the most useful we have, yet over time we do our best to push away fear, and attempt to name it something else, or hide from it. This often leaves us confused and unable to be ourselves, and if labeled something else, can become damaging, debilitating,  and even unsafe. Using the instinct of fear can have it be a valuable resource.  When we let fear be just that - fear - we often can then deal with the emotions, (see below) that are associated with our mislabeling fear, when the emotion present is actually  sadness, anger, depression, confusion, irrationality, feeling melancholy, etc.  Fear can be motivating as well as it can peak our ability to observe as well as perform.  It is a means to keeping us safe and it is important.

Emotions:  At this time, it is difficult to discern the emotions that arrive with us at our birth, developing mostly over time in the first years of our lives and into young adults. Clearly anger appears at an early age, so we may consider anger as an elemental, and possibly two others we would like considered; contentment and interest. Contentment could be said to be marked by a feeling of satisfaction, safety, or even inner peace, and interest is that emotion that has us focus, pay attention to an event, a someone or a process.

No doubt we can find ourselves adapting to that lack of use of the feelings of interest and anger, that may motivate  us or have us communicate, yet consider how much of the emotional feeling called contentment  we do  not appreciate.

Voice: One of our first acts as a human being is to use our voice. We cry out, we shout  ourselves into the world, and as a child we are talkative and full of questions.  Human beings communicate in all kinds of ways, and our voice is one of the most powerful and individual.  Even those who do not have the power of speech, retain the power of their voice.  Much like the elemental human resource touch, we begin to suppress and not use this most basic of resources. The consequences are evident all over the world, and easily demonstrated as something many women quickly adapt to not using.

Relationships:  We are in relationship with a human being even before we enter the world, and the moment we are snatched from our mother’s wombs we are immediately a relational being.  We are now in relationship with heat and cold, soft and hard, other humans, our own selves, the memories immediately being created and the world we begin to sense and observe.  We are always in relationship with something, someone, or somewhere, until we die, yet we quickly adapt to the notion we are not.  No man IS an island, yet over time it may seem we do our best to live on that illusion island.  The only thing we will do alone is die.  As Margaret Wheately shares, “Nothing living lives alone”.  Look around and note how many things you actually are related to, including the cloths on your body and the thoughts you are now having about that.

Participation: Given we are in relationship with the world, we also participate. We are participatory in life from the moment of our birth, yet over time we may adapt to ourselves not participating or only participating where and when and how we think is safe and flattering. We stop taking risks.   We no longer take part.  Simply participating, what we call being a player or playing the game, can move great things.  Beginning something often times leads to the finish as humans are compelled to do all they can to  finish what they begin.

Movement is an elemental resource that connects distance time and space. It allows for perspective and depth. It also is healthy for the brain as well as the body.  To move is to be in relationship with things, people and processes from different angles and allows others to observe your different angles as well.  Like participation, movement is key for our health and like participation; simply making that first move establishes our commitment and cements our goal. Please understand this is more than the ability to move your body.

Communication: Most  people understand  communication is more than speaking, yet this elemental human resource is more than simply getting a message across. Many, if not all of us, begin to adapt to not communicating with others, in particular with people who matter the most to us, or those we perceive as most different from us. This clearly has consequences for us as individuals, families, and communities and as societies.

Memory is often not thought of as a resource yet neuroscience is now demonstrating that it is likely we are already forming memories before our birth, while in our mother’s womb.  And there is long standing evidence that we tend to focus on memories of events that left us embarrassed, fearful and anxious, events where we failed or appeared foolish, or caused sadness, as opposed to intentionally and mindfully managing the existence of memories that bring us experiences of joy, appreciation, and successes.   Over time the memories seem to be fewer and more like each other. Left unmanaged, our memories can become focused on remorse and regret, instead of allowing us to grow and nurture what works.

Mimicry is one of the best ways to learn and something we do very early as infants that can seem endless to an adult who delights in the tongue sticking out, or the blowing of bubbles.  This is an elemental resource that can help us move forward, both in being and knowledge at a quickened pace.  Simply doing as others do, in an area you want to develop, removes a need for perfection and allows for easy practicing.

Cooperation:  Some researchers, anthropologists and philosophers propose that human beings are hard-wired from birth to cooperate. We are cooperative creatures. How quickly have you stopped cooperating with people who you know had great ideas and your interests at heart? How often do you resist this natural elemental resource to cooperate?

Observation: Not just devoted to sight, but a full on effort to resource all our senses.  Babies are on point, from birth, and teenagers and young children are keen observers.  This is the hallmark of the investigator and practicing real observation, combined with other elementals leads to many an explanation, invention, or collaboration.

Tears:  Science tells us that emotional tears, (one of three human types) shed  hormones and other toxins which accumulate during stress. Additional studies also suggest that crying stimulates the production of endorphins, our body’s natural pain killer and feel-good hormones and most of us have experienced the value of a good cry.  It is also a profound elemental form of communication. Unfortunately, this basic and elemental human resource has often been socially manipulated, especially for males and there are obvious consequences. This is a common elemental people share with us as  something they avoid, much like voice and touch.  Grieving, which often includes tears  is an important process for humans both on a community level and individual. The suppression of tears can be harmful.

Laughter is easily demonstrated for the lack of use over time. Small children laugh all the time, and seemingly at will. As we grow, this elemental human resource seems to be drastically reduced and laughing at ourselves almost unheard of. There is a reason a person cannot stay sad for long, if only in the moment, upon entering a room full of people laughing. On the other hand, a person full of good humor, will not become sad by virtue of a room full of sad people.  Beyond the social benefits and attraction to people laughing, it has many direct health benefits. Laughter relieves physical tension and stress, leaving your muscles relaxed for up to 45 minutes after and it decreases stress hormones and increases immune cells and infection-fighting antibodies, thus improving your resistance to disease. Laughter triggers the release of endorphins which  promote an overall sense of well-being and can even temporarily relieve pain. Laughter  also protects the heart improving  the function of blood vessels and increases blood flow, which can help protect you against a heart attack and other cardiovascular problems.

It is important to note that this is not a linear list, nor are we asserting that all humans in existence have adapted to the lack of use of all of these Basic Human Resources we are calling Elementals.  We have little doubt that you can even see the connections elementals can have on other elementals, like tears and laughter related  to the emotion of contentment. It is also important to note that we do not include “capacities”  such as the capacity for language, nor are willing to assert this is a finite list.  Neuroscience,  is and will continue to press our human understanding of ourselves and what it is to be human.  Even the theory  of  being “hardwired” to believe in something is now being stretched  by research and it is our observational yet untested  experience that devotion to something seems very possibly elemental.

The Basic Human Resources: Examples of Compounds
Becoming familiar with one or more Elemental Basic Human resouces involves action and doing.  There is an opportunity to measure through distance, time and form.  This  doing of one or more Elementals may create experiences that one can label and name.  We assert that these experiences of being are a result of the actions one undertakes to reclaim a basic human resource they have adapted to not using.  These experiences can be labeled, and can easily be labeled differently for each person.  Below are some of the Compounds that one may experience in practicing one or more of the Elementals, especially in combination.

* Please note: This is not a finite list nor in any order of importance.

Courage, compassion, creativity, imagination, perspective taking and creating,  curiosity, empathy,  thinking, cognition, wonder, awe, self confidence, collaboration,  humor, love, humility, tenacity, resilience,  persistence, endurance, grit, determination, resourcefulness, leadership, vulnerability, understanding,  awareness, motivation, joy and happiness.
